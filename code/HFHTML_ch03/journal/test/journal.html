    <p>
        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
        road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Passing cars,<br>
        When you can't see,<br>
        May get you,<br>
        A glimpse, of eternity.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be Passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a segway,
        I wan't able to bring a whole lot with me;
        Just the essenti als. As
        Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
            with one segway.</q>
